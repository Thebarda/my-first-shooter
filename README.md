# my-first-shooter

In an apocalypse world, you're Alec. A survivor who trying to go to Green Community, a place where "apparently" every one is accepted and provides security and food. Survive in this dangerous world, fight zombies and... maybe find the peace.

This platform game is a shooter in an apocalpse universe. I didn't find a name for the moment so I named it "my first shooter" by default...

This game is made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).

This is my second game after Godot's tutorial, so, for me, the purpose is to familiarize with game Development and I am trying / discovering some things. 

Here are some features:
 - Move the player (left, right, jump)
 - Move the camera with player
 - Player shoots with a weapon
 - Player picks ammos on the ground
 - Player speaks with allies
 - Allies gives some stuff to the player
 - Player hits and kills zombies
 - Zombies hits and kills player
 - Zombies moves to the player within a range
 - Player can move moveable object (like box)
